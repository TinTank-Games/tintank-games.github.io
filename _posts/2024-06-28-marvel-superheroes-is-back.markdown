After almost 3 years of no updates, Marvel Superheroes is finally back with update 2.0.0!

2.0.0 makes a lot of changes and is a reboot of the mod. Almost all of the textures and functionality of the suits were re-done and changed. Some new superheroes were added and some were removed (most of them temporarily). This update no longer uses pre-existing skins for suits and all of the textures were made by Alextimus9. This update finally works in multiplayer, a long-standing issue with the original MCreator version.
