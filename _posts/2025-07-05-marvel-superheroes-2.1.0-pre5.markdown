Iron Man has been upgraded in 2.1.0-pre5.

This is a pre-release version of 2.1.0, so not all features are added or finished.

### New Suits
Create 19 new suits from Mark 11 to Mark 43. Enable Sentry Mode to have your suits follow you around. Most suits have unique special abilities:
- Mark 17 has an enhanced Unibeam attack.
- Mark 23 is fireproof.
- Mark 25 has a built-in Mining Drill.
- Mark 30 and 33 have built-in blades.
- Mark 37 allows water breathing and faster mining underwater.
- Mark 42 and 43 can be called from almost anywhere in the overworld.
- ...and much more!

### Veronica Satellite
Store suits in Veronica! Craft and send up the Veronica Satellite to begin using the system. Use the Veronica Remote on any suit in Sentry Mode and they will be sent up to space for recall later.
