Quick bug fix!

This is a pre-release version of 2.1.0, so not all features are added or finished.

A pretty game-breaking bug was found, so this tiny pre-release fixes it.

## Changelog
- [Bugfix] Using a syringe now requires a syringe

Available for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.6 and 1.21 with NeoForge on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/marvel-superheroes) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/marvel-superheroes).
