Mutants have gotten a rework in 2.1.0-pre2.

This is a pre-release version of 2.1.0, so not all features are added or finished.

Quicksilver makes his return in this snapshot with a new power. Not only is his speed toggleable, he can also break the sound barrier and create a sonic boom.

Because *Deadpool & Wolverine* is releasing today, this snapshot adds Deadpool. Craft his katanas and double attack. Deadpool and Wolverine also now have an X-Force variant.

Crafting the mutant suits was too easy considering the magnitude of their powers, so we added X-Genes. X-Genes are brewed with Nether Warts and Villager Blood Samples taken with a syringe. Every sample has a 40% chance to brew into X-Genes.

Iron Man, Wasp and Thor have gotten a visual upgrade while flying, looking much better that walking in the air.
