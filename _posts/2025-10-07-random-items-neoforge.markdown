Due to popular demand, we are releasing Random Item for Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 and NeoForge 1.20.3 and higher. All existing features have been added.

As with the Fabric version, the mod does not need to be installed on the client when joining a server or locally hosted world with the mod.

NeoForge will be supported along with Fabric for future releases.

Available for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20+ with Fabric, 1.20.1 with Minecraft Forge and 1.20.3+ with NeoForge on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-item) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/random-items).
