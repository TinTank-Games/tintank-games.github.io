Iron Man makes his return in 2.1.0-pre1!

This is a pre-release version of 2.1.0, so not all features are added or finished.

Since the old version, Iron Man has improved signifigantly. He still has creative flight, repulsors and the unibeam, but the suit now has a power system. Using the repulsors or unibeam drains the power. There is also a very slow ambient power drain that doubles while flying. Build a Suit Charger and power it to charge up your suit. It also doubles as a high-tech armor stand to display your suit collection. The suits now have a Heads-Up Display showing useful information: co-ordinates, direction, suit power, suit durability and targeted mob. The Mark 1 flamethrower spreads fire much more, but runs on fuel now. Any item that can burn in a furnace can be used to fuel the flamethrower. War Machine also returns, but instead of firing bullets, he fires arrows or fireworks at rapid speeds. In the item description of suit helmets, a list of key bindings and what they do will be there, to help people figure out how to use the suit.
