We have made our fair share of games, all of which are available for download or in-browser play at [itch.io](https://tintank-games.itch.io)

## Jammed
The Jammed trilogy is a collection of silly games where you play as a jar of jam. These were all made during different game jams.
#### [Jammed: A Sticky Situation](https://tintank-games.itch.io/jammed-a-sticky-situation)
Jammed: A Sticky Situation is a small game where your main objective is to escape the kitchen while trying not to shatter yourself.
#### [Jammed 2: Mission Jampossible](https://tintank-games.itch.io/jammed-2-mission-jampossible)
In Jammed 2: Mission Jampossible, after escaping the kitchen, Strawberry Jam assembles a team of fellow jams and Peanut Butter to infiltrate the Jam factory and rescue the baby jams.
#### [Jammed 3: Trapped in Time](https://tintank-games.itch.io/jammed-3)
Jammed 3: Trapped in Time takes place right after the previous installment, and the jams have been captured and put in a time loop. On their mission to escape the loop and defeat Hazel Nutspread, they meet some new jams.
## Other Game Jam Projects
Along side the Jammed series, we have made other standalone projects for game jams.
#### [Sliming Away](https://tintank-games.itch.io/sliming-away)
A short, but sweet game where you need to merge with other slimes to grow stronger and defeat bosses.
#### [Don't Die Johnathan](https://tintank-games.itch.io/dont-die-johnathan)
Our latest game where your goal is to stop the scarecrow from playing with dangerous things on the farm.
